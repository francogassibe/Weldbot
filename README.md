     
    This is a Robotics proyect where we are going to be working on the fundamentals of kinematics. 

    We choosed 5 degrees of freedom Robot for welding.

    
    Workspace and reach of the task
    Direct kinematics
    Inverse kinematic
    Generating the trajectories
    Simulation
    
    The detailed information of the project is on the  'explanaition'  power point presentation.
